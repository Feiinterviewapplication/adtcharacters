# Rick and Morty Api Application

# Architecture
This application uses MVVM pattern, with Dependency Injection, networking should be separated into a different library.

## Note
You must include the `API_URL` in your local.properties file in order for this code to compile and build.
So create a local.properties file in your project directory with this key set:
`API_URL =https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/`

That should allow you to compile and build the project.
